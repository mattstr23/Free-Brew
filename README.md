Once into one of the pages you can navigate using the navbar up top.
Pages consist of the Home/index page, a register page, a info page, and a logging page for user input to interact with the backend database.
The register page/area does send user input to the database, but no functionality otherwise.
The main front end to back end occurs on the PourLog page.

Here users can communicate to the database with brewery info and beer info, layed out as so:
-Brewery: Name, date visited, city, state.
-Beer: Name, type, maker.
Users can also delete any inputs created in either field.
Frontend to Backend flow is charted below.
